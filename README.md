### Quick Start

#### Requirements

`git`, `docker`, `docker-compose`, `node` at least suggested 20.19.0

Uses the [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) file to setup the application with the database. You can define all ENV variables in the [`.env`](.env.example) file from the `.env.example`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/polaroi8d/cactoide/
cd cactoide
cp env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

### Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/polaroi8d/cactoide/
cd cactoide
cp env.example .env
make db-only
npm run dev -- --open
```

Your app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. You can use the Makefile commands to run the application or the database, eg.: `make db-only`.

Use the `database/seed.sql` if you want to populate your database with dummy data.

### Options

#### 1. Landing page option

Supports a conditional landing page display based on the `PUBLIC_LANDING_INFO` environment variable. If you don't want to show your users the cactoide landing page, just use the `PUBLIC_LANDING_INFO=false` variable. This will automatically remove the landing home page and redirect users to the `/discover` page.

This is useful for:

- Creating a minimal discovery-focused experience
- Customizing the user journey based on deployment environment

#### 2. i18n

There is no proper i18n implemented, we have an `/i18n` folder with specific languages. To use an existing translation, just rename the language code JSON file to `messages.json` and you are ready to go. If you would like to add a new translation (which is really appreciated), just create a new `<language_code>.json` file and add the translations from the `messages.json`.

The project includes a translation validation script to ensure all translation files are complete and up-to-date with the source `messages.json` file.

```bash
# Validate all translation files
make i18n
```

```bash
# Validate a specific translation file
make i18n FILE=src/lib/i18n/it.json
```
